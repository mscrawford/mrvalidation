#' @title ValidGlobalCarbonBudget
#' @description validation for total and cumulative land emissions from the Global Carbon Budget, including
#' all bookkeeping models
#'
#' @details
#' The historical series pooled under \code{Emissions|CO2|Land|+|Land-use Change} are all LUC-scale CO2
#' SOURCES and are broadly comparable to MAgPIE's \code{+|Land-use Change}. Verified against the ingested
#' validation data (not the parent publications), they form a single positive cloud (Mt CO2/yr, World,
#' 2000-2010): bookkeeping BLUE/OSCAR/GCB/H&C ~2600-6600 and the national-statistics series
#' FAO_EmisLUC/EDGAR_LU/PRIMAPhist ~2800-5400 - the latter numerically indistinguishable from the
#' bookkeeping cloud. They differ mainly on PEAT; a second, conceptual axis (INDIRECT/Grassi) matters in
#' principle but is NOT represented in the ingested data (see Axis 2):
#' \tabular{lll}{

#' Axis 1 - PEAT. GCB folds a common peat drainage & fires term (~0.7-1.7 Gt CO2/yr) into EVERY bookkeeping
#' model's net, though only GCB's block breaks it out as a column (verified: each model's net exceeds the sum
#' of its ex-peat components by exactly that peat). So \code{+|Land-use Change} is already consistently
#' incl-peat across all four models, matching MAgPIE's \code{+|Land-use Change} (which also includes peat).
#' The function reads GCB's peat column and adds, for all four models, a matching \code{...|+|Peatland} child
#' (closing the net-vs-components gap) and \code{...|Land-use Change|Excl Peatland} (net of peat, matching
#' MAgPIE's peat-excluded line). Gasser and the national-statistics series are handled elsewhere.
#'
#' Axis 2 - INDIRECT (Grassi) - NOT represented in the ingested data. In principle the bookkeeping-vs-NGHGI
#' gap (~5 Gt CO2/yr; Grassi et al. 2021, doi:10.1038/s41558-021-01033-6) arises because country inventories,
#' reporting the sink-inclusive NET LULUCF over a large managed-land area, embed the environmental sink and
#' sit far BELOW bookkeeping ELUC - which would make net \code{Emissions|CO2|Land} the matching counterpart.
#' BUT none of the FAO_EmisLUC/EDGAR_LU/PRIMAPhist series ingested here is that Grassi-adjusted NGHGI net:
#' FAO is FAOSTAT's net "Land Use total" (its forest sink included but modest, so still a ~4 Gt SOURCE),
#' EDGAR/PRIMAP are LULUCF CO2 series - all positive, LUC-scale, none carrying a net-flux or Indirect sink
#' series. They must therefore be compared to MAgPIE's \code{+|Land-use Change} like the bookkeeping sources,
#' NOT to net Land. The sink-inclusive NGHGI-net quantity Grassi contrasts with bookkeeping is absent from
#' this validation cloud, so MAgPIE's own \code{+|Indirect} (its Grassi managed-land sink ~-5.6 Gt CO2/yr,
#' \code{i52_land_carbon_sink}) has no inventory counterpart here to validate against.
#'
#' GCB note - every workbook model's net INCLUDES the common peat drainage & fires (verified: World 2010, GCB
#' 5181 / BLUE 6156 / OSCAR 5775 / H&C 3612, each = its ex-peat components + ~943 peat). GCB's block is the
#' only one that lists peat as a separate column. That peat column is now read and attached as a +|Peatland
#' child to all four, so net = components + peat holds and the Excl Peatland variant matches MAgPIE's line.
#'
#' Do NOT benchmark net Land against GCB: the only Indirect / net \code{Emissions|CO2|Land} series here is
#' GCB's, where Indirect = the GCB terrestrial sink S_LAND over ALL land (World 2020: -11403 Mt CO2/yr,
#' ~the whole-biosphere sink), NOT the managed-land Grassi quantity MAgPIE reports.
