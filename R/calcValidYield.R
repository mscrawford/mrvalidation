#' @title calcValidYield
#' @description
#' Calculates a dataset of agricultural production out of the combined
#' data of calcFAOharmonized(). Covers dry matter (DM) production.
#' Also returns areas of individual crops from FAOSTAT.
#' Total area can be lower or higher than arable land because of multicropping or fallow land.
#' Returns yield as calculated from area area and production.
#'
#' @param datasource Specify which datasource needs to be used.
#'                   Currently only "FAO" and "calibratedLPJmL" is available.
#' @param future     if NULL no future values are returned (default).
#'                   specify climate scenario (gcm:rcp), if future is needed
#' @param physical if true (default) physical area (croparea) used for yield calculation;
#'                 if false harvested area used for yield calculation
#'
#' @return List of magpie objects with results on country level,
#'         weight on country level, unit,
#'         Max.&Min. values alongwith description.
