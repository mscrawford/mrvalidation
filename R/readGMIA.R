#' @description Read Global Irrigation Map
#'
#' Read the Data from Siebert et.al on Irrigated Areas for each Country. Data
#' contains total valuesas well as values from groundwater, surface water and
#' non convential water sources for the following Categories:
#' \itemize{
#' \item Area equipped for Irrigation (AEI)
#' \item Area acutally irrigated (AAI)
#' \item Consumption Irrigatoin Water use (ICU)
#' }
#' The following Data is also available spatialy explicit with a resolution of 5 arcmin:
#' \itemize{
#' \item AEI in Percent
#' \item AEI in Ha
#' \item AAI as percent of AEI
#' \item AEI from groundwater sources as percent of total AEI
#' \item AEI from surface water sources as percent of total AEI
#' \item AEI from non conventional sources as percent of total AEI
#' }
#' There also exists a correct function to aggregate the data to 0.5 degree resolution,
#' set convert="correctonly" to run.
#'
#'
#' @param subtype : Available subtypes are:
#' \itemize{
#' \item all_data_national : National Data on AEI (including differentiation by source
#' (Groundwater, Surface water and nonconventional)), AAI
#' \item aei_pct : AEI in Percent
#' \item aei_ha : AEI in ha
#' \item aai_pct_aei : AAI as percentage of AEI
#' \item aeigw_pct_aei AEI from Groundwater sources as Percentage of total AEI
#' \item aeisw_pct_aei : AEI from Surface water sources as Percentage of total AEI
#' \item aeinc_pct_aei : AEI from nonconventional sources as Percentage total AEI
#' }
